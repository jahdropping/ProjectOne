        <br>

           <p>
            i find that a majority of my inspirations comes from music, films, youtube,<br>
            and artists that I follow on social media. the first artist that inspires<br>
            me is lucki, a well-know rapper from chicago. lucki is influential for the<br>
            underground hip-hop scene, the thing that pulls me to his music his own style,<br>
            no one sounds like. he inspires me to create the way i want to and to be true to myself.

            <p>
            the second artist that inspires me is prominent fashion and streetwear brand photographer rueguh.<br>
            i found rueguh's work early in his career before he started photographing for brands like adidas, balenciaga and<br>
            artists lucki and post malone. following his career is inspiring to me because it shows me the work<br>
            i need to put in to get where i want to be.

        <br>
            <p>
               the third artist that inspires me is artist chandrika metivier,<br>
                creating installations with performance-theatre, soft sculptures, <br> 
                and text-based paintings on public structures. metivier's work inspires me because <br>
                they make installations from personal experiences to illuminate global issues.
