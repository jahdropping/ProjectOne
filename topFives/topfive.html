            <p>
              i chose these five movies as the best ones that i saw to come out in 2024 because there was not a point <br>
                during any of these movies where i wanted to critque or say something negative about them. these were all great, <br>
                i gave all of these movies four to five stars on letterbox.

              these five movies are my top five ever because i can sit through each one and it would <br>
                feel like i am watching the movie for the first time. each movie is different frome each other.<br>
                10/10 would reccommend, each movie is five stars on my letterbox.
