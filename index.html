        <p> i am a student at san fransico state university, in my second semster as a transfer student,
            studying visual communication design. when i am not in school or studying, i am working,
            running or lifting. i love my five year old pitbull harley, she's a covid dog and my weird mini golden
            doodle who i got a couple years ago, her name is coco. as of recently
            i became a avid movie watcher and enjoy watching all kinds of movies, then reviewing and rating them.
            in the next five years i hope to have a good job as a ux designer, running marathons every year, and 
            an triathlete with the goal to complete an ironman. as of this year 2025 i traveled out the united states,
            going across thailand for two weeks, this experience opened my eyes to now wanting to explore the world
            and plan to live overseas in my twenties. i was born and raised in the bay area, the east bay to be exact,
            wouldn't want to have been brought up anywhere else. i use chopsticks with my left hand but i am right handed.
            i can't say i've always wanted to be an artist or a designer, i've only just landed on the idea of what i want to
            in the future and i like the path i'm on, i like what i am learning so that is a huge confidence boost. my semester goals
            is to have B's or higher in each class, to attend every class, and study throughout the week. i work at two nightclubs
            in san fransico as a bartender. i am filipino and proud. i love to cook, i learned how to cook during covid, i've never 
            undercooked or overcooked steak, it might be my secret talent.
