    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p> 
            Elijah is a student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Visual Communications Design. Elijah is a Bay Area native, 
            born and raised in Union City. Being a designer and artist is a new path that he has landed on and is committed and excited for the future 
            Elijah is inspired by the new age of media, music, and movies. His goals are to keep learning about design and have a fulfilling career 
            in the field. He enjoys being able to work and learn with different mediums to create works of art. As he continues his journey, 
            Elijah remains dedicated to honing his craft and finding new ways to express steez.

            Elijah has had an up-and-down journey through his academic career, but eventually found his way to San Francisco State, coming as a 
            transfer from Ohlone College in Fremont. Digital graphics design was something he admired and wanted to do, but starting college he 
            decided to start from the basics of art, getting an Associates degree in Art and Studio Arts before transferring. After high school, he spent
            more time hustling to get money, working part-time jobs and selling clothes online, but soon realized that he needed to prioritize his education. 
            He made a deal with himself to transfer before fully committing to work again. Now, he has moved on from the idea of pursuing a career in digital graphics 
            and is committed to becoming a UX/UI designer after graduating, while still doing digital graphics as a side hustle and hobby. Alongside this, after graduating, 
            Elijah plans to live abroad somewhere in East Asia, wanting to experience a different way of life.

            Elijah is passionate about staying active, exploring the world, and embracing new experiences. He enjoys running and is currently training for 
            his first marathon this year. His love for travel grew after leaving the U.S for the first time this year, going on a trip to Thailand, which 
            motivated him to travel more in the future. Over the past year Elijah has become an avid movie watcher, expanding his taste and genres, and appreciating 
            different styles of storytelling. Fishing is another hobby Elijah loves, where he finds peace in the patience it requires. He enjoys being outdoors, especially hiking with
            his pitbull Harley.
