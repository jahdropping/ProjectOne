            Elijah is a student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Visual Communications Design. Elijah is a Bay Area native, <br>
            born and raised in Union City. Being a designer and artist is a new path that he has landed on and is committed and excited for the future <br>
            Elijah is inspired by the new age of media, music, and movies. His goals are to keep learning about design and have a fulfilling career <br>
            in the field. He enjoys being able to work and learn with different mediums to create works of art. As he continues his journey, <br>
            Elijah remains dedicated to honing his craft and finding new ways to express steez.

            Elijah has had an up-and-down journey through his academic career, but eventually found his way to San Francisco State, coming as a <br>
            transfer from Ohlone College in Fremont. Digital graphics design was something he admired and wanted to do, but starting college he <br>
            decided to start from the basics of art, getting an Associates degree in Art and Studio Arts before transferring. After high school, he spent <br>
            more time hustling to get money, working part-time jobs and selling clothes online, but soon realized that he needed to prioritize his education. <br>
            He made a deal with himself to transfer before fully committing to work again. Now, he has moved on from the idea of pursuing a career in digital graphics <br>
            and is committed to becoming a UX/UI designer after graduating, while still doing digital graphics as a side hustle and hobby. Alongside this, after graduating, <br>
            Elijah plans to live abroad somewhere in East Asia, wanting to experience a different way of life.

            Elijah is passionate about staying active, exploring the world, and embracing new experiences. He enjoys running and is currently training for <br>
            his first marathon this year. His love for travel grew after leaving the U.S for the first time this year, going on a trip to Thailand, which <br>
            motivated him to travel more in the future. Over the past year Elijah has become an avid movie watcher, expanding his taste and genres, and appreciating <br>
            different styles of storytelling. Fishing is another hobby Elijah loves, where he finds peace in the patience it requires. He enjoys being outdoors, especially hiking with <br>
            his pitbull Harley.
